# Dynamic Web Interface

[Inspired by this tweet from Jordan Singer](https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1641108150349873153?s=20)

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com)
- [Langchain JS](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs)

## Set up

First, make sure you run `pnpm` install.

Next, run `cp .env.example .env` and then add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env`.

Finally run `pnpm dev` and the app should be up at localhost:3000!
